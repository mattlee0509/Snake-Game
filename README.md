# Snake-Game
Created a snake game using Pygame and Object Oriented Programming.
Used a blocking system to make the snake move on a grid. 
The snake moves by deleting the block in the back and adding one to the front. 
When the snake eats it only adds one from the front so it grows.
Colors and graphics can be easily changed to ones liking. 
Small bugs may occur.
